            <h1>Hi there! I'm Colin Siles</h1>

            <p>I'm a student at Colorado School of Mines pursuing a B.S.  in
            Computer Science, with a focus in Data Science. My interests include web
            development, machine learning, and distributed systems. I plan to pursue
            a Master's in Computer Science upon completion of my Bachelor's.</p>

            <p>I fell in love with coding when I was about ten, programming a
            Lego robot to do anything I could imagine.  Since then, I've
            continued learning new things, including machine learning, artifical
            intelligence, full-stack web development, API design, SOLID design
            principles, and more, through personal projects, and industry
            experience. I'm excited to continue learning new skills!</p>

            <p>Outside of software development, I'm also passionate about being
            a mentor, and sharing my knowledge to help others expand their own
            arsenal of skills. In my free time, I enjoy coding, running, solving
            puzzles (e.g. Sudoku, Rubik's Cubes), cooking, and reading.</p>
