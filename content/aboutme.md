I'm a student at Colorado School of Mines pursuing a B.S. in
Computer Science, with a focus in Data Science. My interests include
full-stack web development, machine learning, and distributed
systems. I plan to pursue a Master's in Computer Science upon
completion of my Bachelor's.

I fell in love with coding when I was about ten, programming a
Lego robot to do whatever I could imagine. Since then, I've
continued expanding my repetoire of skills, through personal
projects, formal education, and industry experience. I'm excited to
continue learning new skills!

Outside of software development, I'm also passionate about being
a mentor, having been a TA for Computer Science classes for many
semesters. In my free time, I enjoy coding, running, solving
puzzles (e.g. Sudoku, Rubik's Cubes), cooking, and reading.
