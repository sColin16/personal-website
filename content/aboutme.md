I'm a student at Colorado School of Mines pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science,
with a focus in Data Science. My interests include full-stack web development,
machine learning, and distributed systems.

I fell in love with coding when I was ten and got a Lego robot that I could
program to do anything I could imagine.  Since then, I've continued expanding my
repertoire of skills, through personal projects, formal education, and industry
experience. I love learning new skills and technologies!

Outside of software development, I'm also passionate about being a mentor,
having been a TA for Computer Science classes for many semesters. In my free
time, I enjoy coding, running, solving puzzles (e.g. Sudoku, Rubik's Cubes),
cooking, and reading.
