I am a technology consultant for Credera, where I act as a Software Engineer and
Data Scientist. My technical interests include full-stack web development,
machine learning, programming language design, and distributed systems.

I fell in love with coding when I was only ten years old, building contraptions
with a Lego robotics kit. I continued learning Computer Science after that,
eventually studying it at Colorado School of Mines. I love learning new things,
solving problems, and building products!

Outside of the technical realm, I'm passionate about being a mentor to pay
forward the support I've received from my own mentors. I served as a TA and the
President of ACM during my time at Mines, helping other students learn CS. In my
free time, I enjoy coding, running, solving puzzles (e.g.  Sudoku, Rubik's
Cubes, ICPC), cooking, and reading.
