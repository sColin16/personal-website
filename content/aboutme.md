I completed my undergrad in Computer Science in May 2022, and I am now a
technology consultant for Credera, where I act as a Software Engineer and Data
Scientist. My technical interests include full-stack web development, machine
learning, programming language design, and distributed systems.

I fell in love with coding when I was only ten years old, and I began building
contraptions with a Lego robotics kit. Shortly after, I learned JavaScript on
Khan Academy, experimented with Python, and eventually studied Computer Science
at Colorado School of Mines. I love learning new things, solving problems, and
building products!

Outside of the technical realm, I'm passionate about being a mentor to pay
forward the support, advice, and opportunities I've received from my own
mentors. I served as a TA and the President of ACM during my time at Mines,
helping other students to learn CS, both in and out of the classroom. In my free
time, I enjoy coding, running, solving puzzles (e.g.  Sudoku, Rubik's Cubes,
ICPC), cooking, and reading.
